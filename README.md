## Introduction

Wildfires are a significant threat to both human lives and the environment. Early prediction and prevention are essential to minimize their impact. This wildfire prediction model aims to provide a tool for forecasting the likelihood of a wildfire outbreak in a specific region. By analyzing various features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and historical wildfire data, the model can provide valuable insights to help authorities and organizations take proactive measures to prevent or mitigate wildfires.

## Data

To train and evaluate this wildfire prediction model, we used a comprehensive dataset that includes:

- Historical weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, etc.)
- Geographical information (latitude, longitude, elevation)
- Land cover and vegetation data
- Historical wildfire records

The dataset is not included in this repository, but you can obtain it from reliable sources such as government agencies, meteorological organizations, or environmental research institutions.

## Model Architecture

The wildfire prediction model is built using machine learning techniques, primarily supervised learning. The model uses a combination of regression and classification algorithms to predict both the likelihood and intensity of wildfires. Here's a high-level overview of the model's architecture:

1. Data Preprocessing: Data is cleaned, normalized, and transformed to make it suitable for training.

2. Feature Selection: Relevant features are selected based on their importance for wildfire prediction.

3. Model Training: The model is trained using historical data and various algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.

4. Model Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. Prediction: The trained model is used to make predictions for new data, providing insights into wildfire likelihood and intensity.
